# more-hints
This is a mod I made to add stupid hint messages to other levels.

# What exactly does this do?
Exactly as it says!

## Stereo Madness and Polargeist
These levels have hints that are shown using the show hint function.
```cpp
if (levelID > 2){
  return;
if (levelID == 1){
  ...
}
else{
  ...
}
```
# How do I add custom hints?
Edit the code motherfucka
